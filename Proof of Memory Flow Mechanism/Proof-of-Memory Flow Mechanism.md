Proof-of-Memory Flow Mechanism

1.	Abstract:
A method for deriving cryptographic proofs from atomic memory-pressure events and converting those proofs into an intangible memory-flow signal that dynamically drives emergent system behaviors without reliance on token-based mechanisms.

2.	Technical Field:
The present invention relates to decentralized process orchestration and blockchain-based memory systems, and more particularly to theory-level methods for generating and weaving memory-flow signals from on-chain events.

3.	Background:
Current decentralized systems often use token-based incentives or fixed schedules to coordinate processes. Such approaches overlook the intrinsic informational value in historical event logs. This invention harnesses on-chain memory events as a living substrate, where each proof contributes to an emergent flow-driven dynamic.

4.	Summary:
The Proof-of-Memory Flow Mechanism encompasses:
    1. Observation of atomic memory-pressure events across traditional blockchain nodes and PoM subchains.
    2. Generation of cryptographic proofs for each observed event to ensure integrity.
    3. Conversion of proofs into flow units and aggregation into a continuous memory-flow signal.
    4. Weaving of flow signals from multiple subchains to form pressure points that modulate system behavior.

5.	Detailed Description:
Conceptually, each on-chain event—whether a block transaction or PoM subchain record—yields a proof. These proofs act as atomic impulses in a global memory field. As proofs accumulate, they form a continuous flow signal. Interactions among multiple flow streams generate pressure points analogous to peaks in a physical medium, which can be interpreted by participants to coordinate emergent behaviors or achieve non-tokenized agreement.

6.	Method Flow:
    Step 1: Event Observation – Collect on-chain events from blockchain nodes (PoS, PoA, PoW) and proof-of-memory subchains.
    Step 2: Proof Generation – For each event, create a cryptographic proof capturing event identity and context.
    Step 3: Flow Conversion – Map each proof to a flow unit; aggregate flow units over time into a continuous signal.
    Step 4: Pressure Weaving – Combine flow signals from multiple sources to identify pressure points where flow peaks occur.

7.	Narrative Worked Example:
Imagine Domains X, Y, and Z each minting proofs. Over 30 seconds, Domain X mints at t=0s and t=10s, Domain Y at t=5s, and Domain Z at t=12s. The clustered proofs between t=5–12s form a peak in the flow signal, naturally defining a pressure point at t≈10s, prompting participants to initiate coordinated actions.

8.	Algorithmic Worked Example:
In an alternative embodiment, flow units F are computed via F = w_p * 1 + w_r / Δt, where w_p=1.0 and w_r=0.5.
For events at t=0s (F0=1.0) and t=5s (F1=1.0 + 0.5/5 = 1.1), a simple moving average B with window 2 yields B1=(1.0+1.1)/2=1.05. Since F1 > B1, a pressure point is recorded at t=5s.

9.	Potential Embodiments:
    1. Embodiments using moving averages, EMA, or percentile-based filters to illustrate controlled flow dynamics.
    2. Embodiments where natural proof inter-arrival patterns alone yield observable pressure points.
    3. Embodiments combining privacy-preserving proofs (e.g., ZKPs) with flow generation.
    4. Embodiments leveraging hierarchical subchain layers to modulate flow per chain level.

10.	 Implementation Notes:
Proofs are recorded directly on-chain via one-action-one-mint transactions; no external scripts or endpoints are required. All proofs persist permanently, contributing to the memory-flow substrate.

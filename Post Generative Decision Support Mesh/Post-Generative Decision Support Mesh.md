TITLE
[0002]	Post-Generative Decision Support Mesh

TECHNICAL FIELD
[0003]	This invention relates to decentralized intelligence systems, civic-scale decision support infrastructure, and reflex-based response models. More particularly, it enables memory-driven coordination and policy activation without centralized dashboards, predictive modeling, or black-box inference.

BACKGROUND
[0004]	Current decision-support systems in civic, institutional, or operational domains typically rely on predictive algorithms, logic graphs, and centralized interfaces. These platforms require privileged access, custom analytics layers, and behavioral inference, making them opaque, fragile, and often extractive. Their reliance on external data ownership, probabilistic modeling, and loss-prone architectures limits long-term trust and auditability.

[0005]	A need exists for a post-generative coordination substrate in which agents, traits, and memory fields govern systemic behavior driven by anchored contributions and emergent pressure rather than AI heuristics or administrative control.


SUMMARY
[0006]	The Post-Generative Decision Support Mesh enables decentralized coordination, analysis, and reflection without predictive modeling or centralized dashboards. The method comprises:

1.	Agents and Traits anchor reflections, civic events, and observations immutably into a shared memory mesh.

2.	The system monitors memory over time for emergent pressure conditions, including contradiction, silence, or protocol drift.

3.	When thresholds are met, reflex logic is triggered automatically—activating agents, surfacing memory, or minting policy escalations.

4.	All logic is executed internally via deterministic modules—no generative AI, external APIs, or administrative overrides.

5.	Reflex outcomes are logged as one-action-one-mint events, forming an immutable audit trail of system cognition and response.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0007]	The mesh initializes a layered memory architecture, where agents contribute events, observations, or reflections through atomic, immutable actions. Traits continuously monitor the mesh for tension signatures, such as:

1.	Gaps (prolonged silence or missing follow-up)

2.	Overlap (contradictory entries)

3.	Drift (divergence from protocol)

4.	Ethical friction (flagged by trait-specific heuristics)

[0008]	Reflex logic is activated when pressure exceeds a threshold. This does not infer or predict; it reacts solely to what has been anchored, resolving tension through predefined actions. 

[0009]	Reflex actions may include:

1.	Surfacing historic memory

2.	Spawning coordination agents

3.	Flagging protocol misalignment

4.	Logging system-level escalations

[00010]	All reflex outputs are minted immutably via one-action-one-mint enforcement. No central compute, dashboards, or inference passes are required.

METHOD FLOW
1.	Memory Anchoring – Agents log actions, reflections, or data as immutable events in the memory mesh.

2.	Tension Detection – Traits monitor for pressure signatures across memory layers.

3.	Reflex Triggering – Reflex logic is invoked when tension surpasses predefined thresholds.

4.	Reflex Execution – The system deterministically executes one or more response actions.

5.	Outcome Anchoring – Each reflex is logged as a single mint event, forming a complete tension-resolution loop.

NARRATIVE USE CASE
[00011]	A community-run platform logs transportation disruptions, civic events, and silence zones via autonomous agent contributions. Over time, tension builds across several geographic clusters due to conflicting entries and prolonged silence.

[00012]	When thresholds are met:

1.	The system reflexively surfaces historic data tied to those regions

2.	Executes protocols according to outcome requirements

3.	Anchors drift signals against existing civic protocols

4.	Logs all actions as one-action-one-mint entries

[00013]	No prediction model was used. No analyst dashboard was consulted. All actions emerged from memory tension alone.


IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
[00014]	Reflex triggers originate exclusively from anchored tension—never inferred states.

[00015]	System operates across L2–L6 memory layers, with Layer 4 serving as reflex execution logic.

[00016]	Trait modules interpret drift, ethical strain, or unacknowledged divergence without enforcing state changes.

[00017]	The system is modular and may be embedded in any civic substrate with agent-based memory anchoring.

CLAIMS
1.	A decentralized decision support system comprising a reflex mesh of memory-anchored agents and traits, configured to coordinate actions based solely on emergent tension.

2.	A method for triggering civic or institutional reflex actions using deterministic thresholds over anchored memory, without reliance on AI inference or probabilistic models.

3.	A system wherein pressure conditions are detected based on absence, contradiction, protocol drift, or trait-flagged ethical friction.

4.	A system wherein all reflex actions are immutably recorded using a one-action-one-mint mechanism.

5.	A non-generative cognition mesh wherein coordination arises from memory comparison, not behavioral prediction or inference.

6.	A layered memory framework in which reflex execution occurs at a designated protocol layer and is triggered by state-independent thresholds.

7.	A recursive system wherein each epoch re-evaluates prior tension, memory, and reflex behavior to drive long-term coordination without centralized administration.

8.	A method wherein reflex actions may be preceded by trait-based observation without requiring administrative approval or external supervision.

9.	A method wherein reflex actions trigger follow-up protocol anchoring, value redistribution, or memory surface events based on preconfigured outcome types.

ABSTRACT
[00018]	A decentralized reflex mesh for institutional or civic-scale coordination, wherein agents and traits contribute anchored memory over time. The system monitors memory for tension signatures, and when pressure exceeds defined thresholds, reflex actions are deterministically triggered. No inference, prediction, or external control is used. All reflexes are recorded via one-action-one-mint logic, enabling transparent, auditable, post-generative decision support.

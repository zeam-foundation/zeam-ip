Post-Generative Decision Support Mesh

1.	Abstract
A decentralized system for interpreting and responding to civic-scale pressure through a memory-anchored mesh of reflex logic. The invention enables non-generative civic decision support—where systemic drift, conflict, or anomalies are surfaced through anchored tension and resolved through reflexive coordination among agents—without probabilistic inference, central control, or extractive analytics. The system replaces centralized civic AI platforms with a reflexive substrate grounded in collective memory.

2.	Technical Field
Civic and AI-driven decision support, decentralized policy infrastructure, memory-governed pressure systems.

3.	Background
Existing platforms attempt to model complex civic systems using generative AI, logic trees, and centralized dashboards. These systems are extractive, fragile, and prone to black-box interpretation. They depend on inference, surveillance, and data ownership models that erode trust and transparency. A need exists for a post-generative system where civic decision support emerges from anchored memory and reflex response—without central nodes or predictive modeling.

4.	Summary of Invention
The method comprises:
    1. Agents anchor reflections, civic events, and local observations immutably across a layered civic memory field.
    2. The system monitors for tension accumulation—e.g., silence, protocol drift, unacknowledged divergence.
    3. Layer 4 reflex logic is triggered when pressure exceeds defined thresholds.
    4. Reflex actions include memory surfacing, protocol anchoring, agent spawning, or coordination prompts.
    5. All logic operates without generative inference, centralized compute, or external APIs—entirely within the civic mesh.

5.	Methods:
    1.	Initialize the civic mesh with layered memory architecture (e.g., L2–L6).
    2.	Anchor Agent contributions as immutable entries (e.g., reflections, actions, file uploads).
    3.	Detect tension accumulation through memory field comparison, silence thresholds, protocol drift, or contradiction signals.
    4.	Trigger Layer 4 reflex logic upon crossing system-defined pressure thresholds.
    5.	Surface relevant memory or initiate reflexive actions (e.g., spawning agents, surfacing policies, locking consensus).
    6.	Anchor reflex outcome as a mint entry (one-action-one-mint), completing the tension-resolution loop.
    7.	Repeat per epoch, with memory, pressure, and reflex behavior iteratively shaping civic response.

6.	Claims
    1. A civic-scale reflex mesh for detecting and responding to systemic pressure using memory-anchored Agent contributions.
    2. A method of resolving tension without generative inference, using reflex actions triggered by pressure signatures across memory layers.
    3. A post-generative execution framework where Agent and Trait tension form the basis of civic cognition.
    4. A system where each action is anchored immutably via one-action-one-mint, with no black-box inference layers or extractive analytics.
    5. A civic substrate that enables coordinated decision support, reflection, and redirection based on emergent, shared tension—not predictive modeling.

7.	Narrative Use Case
A community-run platform logs transportation delays, protest activities, and civic silence zones using agent-based reflections. Over time, pressure accumulates in several geographic clusters within the civic memory field. Once the pressure threshold is reached, the system reflexively surfaces historic memory, activates agent coordination, and logs policy redirections—all without generative modeling or administrator involvement. System behavior emerges entirely from pressure-triggered memory anchoring.

8.	Implementation Notes
• Drift and pressure are interpreted from contradictions, silence, or ethical flagging across L2–L6.
• Reflex triggers are activated in Layer 4 using trait tension and anchored civic memory.
• All cognition is post-generative: there is no AI inference, only memory surfacing and reflex coordination.
• System may be layered atop any memory field architecture with agent-based tension anchoring.

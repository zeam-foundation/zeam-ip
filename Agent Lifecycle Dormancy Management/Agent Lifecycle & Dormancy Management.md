Agent Lifecycle & Dormancy Management

1.	Abstract:
A method for managing the lifecycle of autonomous agents in a decentralized memory-driven system, where agents automatically instantiate, enter dormancy, and reactivate in response to emergent memory-flow and pressure signals, without reliance on external schedulers.

2.	Technical Field:
This invention relates to autonomous agent orchestration in distributed ledger environments, and more particularly to theory-level methods for agent instantiation, dormancy management, and reactivation driven by on-chain memory and pressure dynamics.

3.	Background:
Traditional decentralized systems rely on external scheduling services or manual triggers to manage agent lifecycles, leading to inefficiencies and centralization risks. There is a need for a self-regulating framework where agents respond solely to the system’s intrinsic memory-flow and pressure signals.

4.	Summary:
Detecting emergent memory-flow or pressure signals to automatically instantiate agents.
Transitioning agents into a dormant state after predefined inactivity intervals or pressure drop-offs.
Reactivating dormant agents when memory-flow thresholds or new pressure events occur.
Recording lifecycle transitions as one-action-one-mint events for auditability.
Coordinating multiple agents via shared memory-stream signals to optimize resource usage.

5.	Detailed Description:
At the conceptual level, each autonomous agent subscribes to one or more memory-stream or pressure-stream feeds. When the aggregated flow signal exceeds an activation threshold, the system automatically instantiates the agent in a VM or protocol module. Following a period of quiescence—measured by sustained flow below a dormancy threshold—the agent records a dormancy event and ceases active processing. Upon detection of new pressure spikes, dormant agents reactivate, ensuring that agent resources align dynamically with the system’s informational demands.

6.	Method Flow:
Step 1: Activation Monitoring – Continuously monitor memory-flow and pressure metrics across on-chain events.
Step 2: Agent Instantiation – When flow > activation threshold, spin up the agent and mint an activation event.
Step 3: Dormancy Trigger – If flow remains below a dormancy threshold for a grace period, the agent mints a dormancy event and halts.
Step 4: Reactivation Trigger – Upon new flow or pressure spike above threshold, re-instantiate the agent and mint a reactivation event.
Step 5: Lifecycle Auditing – Maintain an immutable log of activation, dormancy, and reactivation events for each agent.

7.	Narrative Worked Example:
An analytics agent watches transaction tension streams. When tension rises above threshold at t=100s, the agent activates and logs its activation. After processing until t=200s with tension below dormancy level, the agent logs dormancy and stops. At t=250s, a sudden tension spike reactivates the agent, which logs reactivation and resumes processing.

8.	Algorithmic Worked Example:

Pseudocode:
    1.	flow_signal = subscribeToFlow(stream_id)
    2.	for event in flow_signal:
    3.	    if not agent.active and event.flow > ACT_THRESH:
    4.	        agent = instantiateAgent()
    5.	        mint_event('AgentActivated', agent.id, event.flow)
    6.	    elif agent.active and event.flow < DORM_THRESH for DORM_PERIOD:
    7.	        mint_event('AgentDormant', agent.id, event.flow)
    8.	        agent.halt()
    9.	    elif not agent.active and event.flow > REACT_THRESH:
    10.	        agent = reactivateAgent(agent.id)
    11.	        mint_event('AgentReactivated', agent.id, event.flow)

9.	Potential Embodiments:
Hierarchical agent lifecycles where supervisors spawn sub-agents based on multi-tier pressure signals.

Privacy-preserving activation via ZKPs to attest agent eligibility without revealing sensitive flow data.

Cross-chain agent networks where pressure on one mesh node triggers agents on another.

Adaptive thresholds learned via reinforcement feedback from NGAC reflections.

10.	Implementation Notes:
Lifecycle transitions use one-action-one-mint transactions for on-chain traceability. Agent code resides in protocol modules or as VM functions; no external scheduler is required.

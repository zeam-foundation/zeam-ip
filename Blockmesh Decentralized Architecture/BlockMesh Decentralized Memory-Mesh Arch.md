TITLE
[0002]	BlockMesh Decentralized Memory-Mesh Architecture

TECHNICAL FIELD
[0003]	This invention relates to multi-chain blockchain architectures and distributed ledger systems, and more particularly to methods for anchoring and querying a decentralized mesh of memory logs.

BACKGROUND
[0004]	Conventional blockchains record all activity in a single chain, leading to scalability bottlenecks and single points of failure. As applications diversify, there is a need for an architecture that maintains parallel memory logs per entity while ensuring global integrity and enabling efficient cross-chain verification.

SUMMARY
[0005]	The BlockMesh Decentralized Memory-Mesh Architecture comprises:
[0006]	Establishing, per entity, a personal subchain storing sequential event logs.
[0007]	Periodically committing each subchain’s state root or anchor hash to a base layer blockchain via on-chain mint transactions.
[0008]	Forming a cryptographic mesh by linking subchain anchors into the base layer.
[0009]	Enabling cross-mesh queries that retrieve and verify subchain logs using cryptographic proofs against the base anchors.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[00010]	At the conceptual level, each participant entity maintains its own memory subchain recording events. Each subchain periodically emits an anchor—such as a chained hash, pointer, or optional Merkle root—that is committed to a common base layer. These anchors collectively form a mesh, ensuring data integrity and non-repudiation across chains. Cross-mesh queries assemble cryptographic proofs from one or more subchains and verify them against the base layer anchors, allowing participants to efficiently retrieve and trust historical records.

METHOD
[00011]	Step 1: Subchain Instantiation – Initialize a personal subchain for each entity to record sequential event logs.
[00012]	Step 2: Anchoring – At regular intervals or based on memory-flow triggers, commit each subchain’s state root or anchor hash to the base layer using a one-action, one-mint transaction.
[00013]	Step 3: Mesh Formation – Maintain cryptographic hash links between subchain anchors and base layer transactions to establish a cohesive mesh.
[00014]	Step 4: Cross-Mesh Query – Upon request, collect cryptographic proofs (e.g., anchor paths) from relevant subchains and verify against corresponding base layer anchors to authenticate events.

NARRATIVE WORKED EXAMPLE
[00015]	Imagine three organizations—OrgA, OrgB, and OrgC—each operating its own subchain. At t1, OrgA anchors hash H1; at t2, OrgB anchors H2; at t3, OrgC anchors H3. A user seeks proof of an event recorded by OrgB. The user retrieves OrgB’s proof path: Event record → block hash → subchain anchor H2, then verifies H2 was committed to the base layer at t2. The mesh ensures the user can trust OrgB’s event via the collective anchors.

ALGORITHMIC WORKED EXAMPLE
[00016]	In an optional embodiment, anchors are Merkle roots. For a subchain with block data blocks B1–B4, compute Merkle root M = MerkleRoot(B1||B2||B3||B4). Embed M in a base layer mint transaction. To prove inclusion of B3, provide a Merkle proof [Hash(B3), sibling hashes], which verifies against M stored on-chain.

EMBODIMENTS
[00017]	Anchoring using chained hashes or pointers without Merkle structures.
[00018]	Dynamic anchoring intervals driven by memory-flow pressure metrics.
[00019]	Identity-anchored subchains using biometric hashes or external oracle signatures.
[00020]	Hierarchical multi-layer subchains (L2–L6) anchoring to intermediate layers before base layer.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
[00021]	Each anchor commit uses a one-action, one-mint on-chain transaction. No off-chain storage or endpoints are required. All subchain logs and anchors persist permanently, creating an immutable memory mesh. Modules read and verify anchors in-chain.
[00022]	Imagine a layered architecture with six chains (L1–L6) anchored by a common Genesis Block at Layer 0.
[00023]	At t1, L1 emits anchor A1 to the Genesis Block; at t2, L2 emits anchor A2 linking to A1; continuing up to L6 emitting A6 in sequence.
[00024]	An event on L3 at t3 creates a cryptographic attestation attached to A3, verifiable through the chain of anchors back to Genesis.
[00025]	Similarly, an event on L5 at t4 attaches to A5, interwoven via L4 and L3 anchors into the mesh.
[00026]	Observers tracing proofs from L3 or L5 reconstruct the layered anchor path: Event → A3 → A2 → A1 → Genesis, demonstrating integrity across layers.
[00027]	Peaks in cross-layer event density—such as simultaneous events on L2, L4, and L6—naturally form pressure points at the mesh’s core.

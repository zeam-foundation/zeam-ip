TITLE
[0002]	Selective Memory Disclosure via Zero-Knowledge Proofs

TECHNICAL FIELD
[0003]	This invention relates to privacy-enhancing technologies in blockchain systems, and more particularly to methods for proving properties of historical memory records using zero-knowledge proofs.

BACKGROUND
[0004]	On-chain memory logs may contain sensitive information that users wish to keep confidential. Conventional proof methods require revealing data to prove statements, compromising privacy. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) offer privacy-preserving verification but have not been applied to selective disclosure in memory-driven systems.

SUMMARY
[0005]	Disclosed is a Selective Memory Disclosure mechanism that enables verifiable assertions over private memory logs without exposing underlying content. The system supports existence, range, and order predicates via zero-knowledge proof circuits. Proofs are generated using memory data, minted as standalone attestations, and verified on- or off-chain. This enables downstream processing, such as value flow or trait activation, based solely on confirmed properties, while preserving the confidentiality of the memory origin.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0006]	The method involves retrieving relevant memory entries from decentralized sources, encoding desired predicates into ZKP circuits (e.g., SNARKs, STARKs, or Bulletproofs), and executing proof generation to produce witness-based proofs. Proofs and minimal public inputs are then submitted for verification, ensuring predicates such as event existence, value ranges, or temporal relationships hold without exposing raw logs.

[0007]	Zero-knowledge proof systems include a variety of cryptographic protocols that enable verification of statements without revealing the underlying data. Common types include:
1.	SNARKs (Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge): compact, fast-to-verify proofs ideal for smart contract environments.
2.	STARKs (Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge): transparent, post-quantum resistant alternatives that avoid trusted setup.
3.	Bulletproofs: shorter proofs for range-type statements with no trusted setup, used in confidentiality-preserving systems.

METHOD FLOW
1.	Predicate Selection – Identify predicates about memory logs to prove (e.g., event inclusion, tension range, chronological order).

2.	Circuit Construction – Translate predicates into an arithmetic or Boolean circuit suitable for a ZKP system.

3.	Proof Generation – Compute the circuit witness from actual memory log data and generate a zero-knowledge proof.

4.	Proof Submission – Provide the proof and public inputs to a verifier component, which may be a smart contract or off-chain verifier.

5.	Verification – Confirm the proof against a verification key, validating the predicates without revealing the underlying logs.

NARRATIVE WORKED EXAMPLE
[0008]	A participant wishes to prove that a transaction 'TX42' occurred before block height 500 without revealing transaction details. They define the predicate 'TX42 exists at index ≤ 500'. A SNARK circuit embeds Merkle path verification and index bound checks. The user generates the proof and submits it to a smart contract. Verifiers confirm the proof, validating existence without revealing transaction data or amounts.

ALGORITHMIC WORKED EXAMPLE
[0009]	A participant wishes to prove the predicate: "TX42 exists before index 500" without disclosing transaction details.

1.	Public Inputs:
root: Merkle root of the memory log
index_bound: upper bound of acceptable index (e.g., 500)
2.	Private Witness (inputs):
path.elements: Merkle proof path elements
path.indices: Merkle sibling directions
path.index: actual index of TX42 in log
3.	Circuit Logic:
Enforce: verify_merkle_path(path.elements, path.indices) == root
Enforce: path.index ≤ index_bound

[00010]	Pseudocode:
path = get_merkle_proof('TX42')
circuit = compile_zkp_circuit('exists_before_index')
witness = {
    'elements': path.elements,
    'indices': path.indices,
    'index': path.index
}
public_inputs = {
    'root': path.root,
    'index_bound': 500
}
proof = SNARK.prove(circuit, witness, public_inputs)
valid = SNARK.verify(circuit.vk, proof, public_inputs)

POTENTIAL EMBODIMENTS
[00011]	Range Proofs – Prove that memory-tension metrics are within a confidential interval.

[00012]	Order Proofs – Demonstrate that event A preceded event B without revealing timestamps.

[00013]	Composite Predicates – Combine multiple conditions (e.g., existence AND range) in a single proof.

[00014]	On-Chain Verification – Deploy proof verification logic in smart contracts for fully on-chain validation.

[00015]	Flow Trigger – Trigger memory-flow or surplus-flow processes upon proof success.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
[00016]	Zero-knowledge proof circuits (e.g., SNARKs, STARKs, Bulletproofs) are constructed per predicate and stored or referenced via on-chain identifiers.

[00017]	Each proof generation follows a one-action-one-mint model, ensuring every selective disclosure event is individually auditable.

[00018]	No raw memory logs are disclosed; all predicates operate on cryptographic commitments or Merkle roots.

[00019]	Verifiers may include smart contracts, trait modules, or off-chain oracles, depending on flow requirements.

[00020]	Predicate logic may optionally be embedded in Trait circuits for reflexive memory evaluation.

ABSTRACT
[00021]	A method for selectively disclosing properties of on-chain memory logs using zero-knowledge proofs. Predicates such as existence, range, or order are encoded into circuits and verified without revealing raw data. Each proof forms a standalone mintable event, enabling downstream execution or flow activation while preserving memory privacy and auditability.
